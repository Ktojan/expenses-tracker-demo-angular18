# Expenses Tracker Demo Angular18

This is my demo Angular project of expences-incomes tracker for a possible "Galaxy traveller" (thanks to Douglas Adams). Implemented in December 2024.
Tech task in brief:
- The user should be able to add expenses and incomes, view the overall balance, and filter records by categories.
- The user can add records for income and expenses through a form (Name, Amount, Type, Category, Date)
- All data must be stored in localStorage so that records persist after a page reload.
- Angular latest version
- Readable and understandable names of variables, classes, functions and methods

Live demo: [Vercel deploy](https://expenses-tracker-demo-angular18.vercel.app/)

## Development server

Run `npm install`, then `npm start` (Node >= 16) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
